This project implements a **Spiking Neural Network (SNN)** for image classification tasks, such as classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The SNN is based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model and is implemented using Python and NumPy.

## Features
- **LIF Neuron Model**: A basic Leaky Integrate-and-Fire neuron implementation.
- **Feedforward SNN Architecture**: Input, hidden, and output layers for image classification.
- **MNIST Dataset Support**: Preprocessing and spike encoding for the MNIST dataset.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for other datasets and tasks.
